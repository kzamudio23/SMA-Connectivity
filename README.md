# SMA-Connectivity
Zedboard uses the XM105 FMC add-on to access high-speed differential signals via SMA connectors. This will be a basic, streamlined setup that signals photonic input into measurable electrical data (LED as a signal). Designed to be further tested with a SPDC laser and APD to convert optical signal into TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) pulses.

Highly likely to try this out with another board that is more versatile after my portfolio hits 500k in the near future

## Note
The Zedboard doesn't have any connections utilizing SMA connectors. This design is intended to be used with the XM105 FMC which is compatible with the LPC socket of the Zedboard. Unfortunately, I don't have one personally, so I just ""borrowed"" (they don't know lol) this part to work on this.

This was inspired by one of my experiences in the QuantumLab course at UChicago, which utilizes educational quantum equipment from qutools. I also want to expand this to demonstreate Wave Particle Dualism, where photons can behave like particles or like waves https://qutools.com/qued/qued-sample-experiments/sample-experiments-wave-particle-dualism/.
